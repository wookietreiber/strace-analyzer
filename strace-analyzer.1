strace\-analyzer \- analyzes strace output
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\f[B]strace\-analyzer\f[] <\f[I]command\f[]> [\f[I]log1\f[]
\f[I]log2\f[] ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f[B]strace\-analyzer\f[] analyzes logs created by \f[B]strace(1)\f[].
There are different analysis commands which are explained in the
\f[B]Analysis Commands\f[] section.
.PP
The file descriptors you see when looking at the logs manually are not
very descriptive, i.e.
to know what happened with which file, pipe, etc.
For this reason, \f[B]strace\-analyzer\f[] associates these file
descriptors with file names.
These associations are made when syscalls like \f[B]open(2)\f[],
\f[B]creat(2)\f[], \f[B]dup(2)\f[] or \f[B]pipe(2)\f[] are read from the
log and are terminated when they get \f[B]close(2)\f[]d.
.PP
There are some \f[B]strace(1)\f[] command line options that are required
for \f[B]strace\-analyzer\f[] to interpret the logs correctly.
The option \f[B]\-T\f[] is required to trace the time spent on the
syscalls themselves.
The option \f[B]\-ttt\f[] is required to trace the syscalls over time.
The option \f[B]\-o\f[] is required to store the logs on disk.
The option \f[B]\-ff\f[] is required for each process to get its own log
file.
The problem with strace and writing syscalls from multiple processes (or
threads) to the same output file is that start and end of a single
syscall are split over two lines and there is no way of merging them
back together with respect to the file descriptor association.
Thus, the resulting \f[B]strace(1)\f[] invocation to create the logs
should look as in the \f[B]EXAMPLES\f[] section.
